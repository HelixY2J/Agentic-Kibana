# TROUBLESHOOTING.md — Agentic SOC Triage Suite

A consolidated symptom → likely cause → fix → confirm playbook spanning deploy,
runtime, and usage of the **vendor-agnostic** suite. Each entry tells you how to
**confirm** the fix.

- How everything is supposed to behave: `docs/USAGE.md`.
- Day-2 operations: `docs/RUNBOOK.md`.
- Security posture: `SECURITY.md`.
- Legacy Kibana-plugin build deep dive: `plugin/BUILD.md`.

Quick triage:

```bash
# Backend health (the agnostic stack publishes :8088; or exec into the container)
curl -s localhost:8088/api/health ; echo
#   -> {"status":"ok","version":"1.0.0","es_connected":...,"store_type":"...","setup_complete":...}

# Same health THROUGH the web UI's nginx proxy (proves the SPA → backend path)
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/api/health ; echo

# Backend logs (errors, schema bootstrap, poll lines, receiver start)
docker logs tlsoc-backend --tail=100

# Web UI (nginx) logs
docker logs tlsoc-webui --tail=50
```

> **`store_type` and `es_connected` are backend-conditional.** With
> `STATE_BACKEND=postgres` or `sqlite`, the suite's OWN state lives in
> Postgres/SQLite, not Elasticsearch — `es_connected` then reflects only whether a
> *pull log source* (if any) is reachable, and `store_type` names the SQL store.
> Push-only deployments may have no ES at all.

## A. State backend won't come up

### A1. Postgres unreachable / wrong `STATE_DB_URL`

**Symptom.** Backend exits or logs `connection refused` / `could not translate
host name` / `password authentication failed`; `GET /api/health` never responds.

**Likely cause.** `STATE_BACKEND=postgres` but `STATE_DB_URL` points at the wrong
host/port/db, the password is wrong, or Postgres isn't up yet.

**Fix.**
- The URL must be a **SQLAlchemy async** URL:
  `postgresql+asyncpg://<user>:<pass>@<host>:5432/<db>` (the `+asyncpg` driver is
  mandatory — a bare `postgresql://` URL won't load the async driver).
- In the agnostic compose the host is the service name `tlsoc-postgres`; the
  password comes from `TLSOC_PG_PASSWORD` in `.env` (compose fails fast if unset).
- The backend `depends_on: tlsoc-postgres: condition: service_healthy`, so a slow
  Postgres delays — not breaks — startup; check `docker logs tlsoc-postgres`.

**How to confirm.** `docker exec tlsoc-postgres pg_isready` → `accepting
connections`; backend logs `Built async SQL engine` + `SQL state schema ensured`;
`GET /api/health` returns `store_type` naming the SQL store.

### A2. pgvector extension missing

**Symptom.** Backend logs `Could not ensure pgvector extension (...); RAG uses
JSON cosine`; RAG works but native kNN does not.

**Likely cause.** The Postgres image lacks the `vector` extension or the role
can't `CREATE EXTENSION`.

**Fix.** Use the **`pgvector/pgvector:pg16`** image (the agnostic compose already
does) or install the extension package and grant create privilege. The suite is
**fail-safe**: without pgvector it degrades to JSON + Python cosine, so this is a
performance/quality note, not an outage.

**How to confirm.** Backend logs `pgvector extension ensured`;
`docker exec tlsoc-postgres psql -U tlsoc -d tlsoc -c '\dx'` lists `vector`.

### A3. Chose the wrong `STATE_BACKEND`

**Symptom.** "Where did my cases go?" after a redeploy; data that was there is
gone, or the backend insists on ES it doesn't have.

**Likely cause.** `STATE_BACKEND` changed between runs. The three backends are
**separate stores** — switching does **not** migrate data.

- `elasticsearch` (default) — own-state in `tlsoc-agent-*` indices (needs the mgmt
  key; see C).
- `postgres` — own-state in Postgres + pgvector (`STATE_DB_URL` required).
- `sqlite` — own-state in a local file (`./tlsoc.db` by default; zero services).

**Fix.** Pick one and keep it. `postgres` **requires** `STATE_DB_URL` (the suite
never guesses production credentials — it raises
`state_backend='postgres' requires state_db_url`). `sqlite` is fine for a
single-node demo but the file must be on a persistent volume to survive restarts.

**How to confirm.** `GET /api/health` `store_type` matches your intent; the data
you expect is listed by `GET /api/cases`.

---

## B. Web UI build / serve issues

**Symptom.** `npm run build` fails; the SPA shows a blank page or 502s on `/api`.

**Likely cause / fix.**
- **Type errors at build** — `npm run build` runs `tsc --noEmit` first. Run
  `npm run typecheck` to see the errors; fix and rebuild.
- **Blank page in production** — the nginx image serves `dist/`; confirm the build
  stage ran (`docker logs tlsoc-webui` shows nginx, not a build error) and that
  `dist/index.html` exists.
- **`/api` 502 from the SPA** — nginx proxies `/api/` to `http://tlsoc-backend:8088`
  (`webui/nginx.conf`). Confirm the backend container is named **`tlsoc-backend`**
  and healthy; LLM calls can be slow, so the proxy uses 300s read/send timeouts.
- **Dev `/api` not reaching the backend** — `npm run dev` proxies `/api` → `:8088`;
  point it elsewhere with `BACKEND_URL=http://my-backend:8088 npm run dev`.

**How to confirm.** `curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/api/health` returns
`{"status":"ok",...}`; the SPA loads and the wizard/console renders.

---

## C. Backend can't reach / own its Elasticsearch state (ES backend only)

> Skip this whole section if `STATE_BACKEND` is `postgres`/`sqlite`.

**Symptom.** With `STATE_BACKEND=elasticsearch`, `health` returns
`es_connected:false`, or `tlsoc-agent-*` indices never appear.

**Likely cause / fix.**
- **Read-only key** `ES_API_KEY` (or `TLSOC_ES_API_KEY`) present + scoped to the
  log indices (`read`, `view_index_metadata`).
- **Management key** `ES_MGMT_API_KEY` present + scoped to `tlsoc-agent-*`
  (`read`, `write`, `create_index`, `view_index_metadata`, `manage`) — an
  under-scoped mgmt key means indices never get created.
- **CA cert** mounted and `ES_CA_CERT`/`ES_VERIFY_CERTS` set; **ES URL** correct
  (container-name DNS on the shared network).

**How to confirm.** `GET /api/health` → `es_connected:true`,
`store_type:RealESClient`; `_cat/indices/tlsoc-agent-*` lists the five indices.

> If `es_store_enabled` is on but ES is unreachable, the backend falls back to an
> **in-memory** store so the spine still runs — data is not durable until fixed.

---

## D. Connector "Test connection" fails

**Symptom.** The wizard / Sources screen "Test connection"
(`POST /api/connectors/test`) returns `ok:false` with a message.

> **A read-only key now reports SUCCESS, not a scary "unreachable".** For a pull
> source the test runs the cheap **scoped read-only search first** and treats *that*
> read as the authoritative gate — it no longer requires `ping()` (`HEAD /`), which
> a least-privilege read-only key cannot do. A correctly-scoped read-only key
> returns **`ok:true, mode:"read_only"`** with a green *"Read-only access verified —
> N events readable in `<pattern>`. Cluster-monitor privilege not granted (expected
> for a read-only key)."* If the key *also* has `cluster_monitor`, you get
> **`ok:true, mode:"full", cluster_monitor:true`** ("Connection verified"). A failed
> `ping()` alone is **no longer** a failure. (See `docs/USAGE.md` §2 "Test
> connection".)

**Likely cause / fix (by source type) — when it genuinely returns `ok:false`:**
- **Bad URL / unreachable** — for a pull source, the `es_url` (or equivalent) is
  wrong or not routable from the backend container. Use the in-cluster container
  name, not `localhost`.
- **Bad key / auth** — the read-only API key is wrong, revoked, or under-scoped (a
  `401`/`403` on the index when the scoped read runs). Re-mint it scoped to the log
  pattern (read-only: `read`, `view_index_metadata`).
- **TLS / cert** — a private CA isn't trusted: supply the CA PEM (`es_ca_cert`) or,
  for a self-signed lab only, turn **"Verify TLS certificates" off** on the source
  (`es_verify_certs:false`). This per-source setting now **actually applies** — the
  backend builds a **per-source ES client** from the source's own
  `es_verify_certs` / `es_ca_cert` / `es_url` / `es_api_key` (it used to fall back
  to the global client, so a source-level `es_verify_certs:false` was ignored and
  you'd see `CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` despite it). The same per-source client
  backs the **Browse logs** endpoint (§D2), so a TLS fix there fixes both.
- **Field-mapping mismatch → connection OK but NO events.** "Test connection"
  proves the scoped read is reachable + authorised; it does **not** prove your
  `source_ip_field` / `user_field` / `host_field` / `rule_field` / `time_field`
  match the source's actual fields. If the mapping is wrong, polling returns rows
  but correlation/scope find nothing → no cases. Verify the field names against a
  real document in the source and fix them on the source (`POST /api/sources`).

**How to confirm.** Test returns `ok:true` (with `mode:"read_only"` or `"full"`); a
manual `POST /api/poll` returns non-zero `polled`/`new`, and `GET /api/cases`
populates.

### D2. "Browse logs" for a source is empty or errors

**Symptom.** The Sources → **Logs** flyout (`GET /api/sources/{id}/logs`) shows no
rows, or returns `501` / `502`.

**Likely cause / fix.**
- **`501` (unsupported)** — the connector doesn't advertise the `browse`
  capability; the "Logs" button only appears for connectors that do (all pull
  connectors + every push receiver).
- **`502` (read failure)** — a **pull** source's scoped read failed: same root
  causes as §D (bad URL, under-scoped key, or **TLS** — set `es_verify_certs:false`
  / supply `es_ca_cert` on the source; the browse endpoint uses the per-source ES
  client, so the source-level TLS setting applies).
- **Empty but `200`** — for a **pull** source, nothing matched the (bounded ≤200)
  scoped search in the chosen time range / `query`; widen the `EuiSuperDatePicker`
  window or clear the search box. For a **push** source, the in-memory live-tail
  buffer (≤500/source) is empty until events arrive — and it is **reset on a backend
  restart** (it is not persisted).

**How to confirm.** A pull source shows rows that match a known document; a push
source shows new events as you send them (turn on the 10s **live tail**).

---

## E. Webhook / HEC push returns 401

**Symptom.** A source POSTing to `POST /api/ingest/{source_id}` gets `401`
(`{"detail":"webhook authentication failed"}`).

**Likely cause.** The receiver's `auth_mode` and the presented credential don't
match.

**Fix.**
- **`auth_mode: bearer`** — the sender must send
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (a `Splunk <token>` or bare token are also
  accepted), and the source's `token` secret (set via
  `POST /api/sources/{id}/secrets`) must match. If `token` is unset, bearer mode
  rejects everything.
- **`auth_mode: hmac`** — the sender must send the hex HMAC-SHA256 of the **exact
  body** in `signature_header` (default `X-Signature`; a `sha256=` prefix is
  tolerated), keyed by the source's `shared_secret`. A different body, encoding, or
  secret fails the constant-time compare.
- **`auth_mode: none`** — accepts anything; use **only** behind a trusted proxy.

Remember per-source secrets live in the **in-memory** tier — after a backend
restart re-set them (`POST /api/sources/{id}/secrets`) or supply them via env.

**How to confirm.** A correctly-signed/bearered POST returns `{"ok":true,...}`
with a non-zero ingest count; the 401s stop.

---

## F. A queue receiver raises `ConnectionError: pip install <lib>`

**Symptom.** A configured Kafka/SQS/Kinesis/Event Hub/Pub-Sub/RabbitMQ/NATS/
MQTT/Redis-Streams/object-store receiver fails to start; logs show
`<module> is required for this connector. Install it with: pip install <lib>`.

**Likely cause.** That receiver's optional client library isn't installed. The
suite imports broker/cloud clients **lazily** (only when the receiver starts), so
the base image ships **without** them — a deployment that uses none of these stays
slim and importable.

**Fix.** Install the library named in the error (it's also in the manifest's
`requires_pip`), then restart the backend:

| Source type | `requires_pip` |
|---|---|
| `kafka` | `confluent-kafka` |
| `aws_sqs`, `aws_kinesis`, `s3` | `boto3` |
| `azure_event_hub` | `azure-eventhub` |
| `gcp_pubsub` | `google-cloud-pubsub` |
| `rabbitmq` | `aio-pika` |
| `nats` | `nats-py` |
| `mqtt` | `paho-mqtt` |
| `redis_streams` | `redis` |
| `gcs` | `google-cloud-storage` |
| `azure_blob` | `azure-storage-blob` |

Add it to a derived backend image (recommended) or `pip install` into the running
container for a quick test. `webhook`, `hec`, `syslog`, and `file` are stdlib-only
(`requires_pip: []`).

**How to confirm.** Backend logs `Started push receiver <id> (<type>)` with no
`Could not start receiver` error.

---

## G. A push / syslog receiver isn't receiving

**Symptom.** A configured syslog/Kafka/queue source shows no events; webhook posts
work but socket/syslog forwarding doesn't.

**Likely cause / fix.**
- **Port not published.** Socket receivers (syslog) bind a port **inside** the
  container (default `514`, configurable `bind_host`/`port`/`protocol`). Docker
  must **publish** that port for external forwarders to reach it — the agnostic
  compose leaves push ports commented; add e.g. `- "1514:1514/udp"` (and/or
  `/tcp`) and recreate the backend. Privileged ports (<1024) need
  `CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE` or a high host port.
- **Receiver didn't start.** Background receivers start on app startup and on
  source save; a missing optional dep (section F) or a config error stops them —
  check `docker logs tlsoc-backend` for `Started push receiver` vs `Could not
  start receiver`.
- **Webhook/HEC are route-driven, not background tasks** — they only receive via
  `POST /api/ingest/{id}`; there is no port to publish for them.

**How to confirm.** Send a test datagram/message; `GET /api/cases` (or the poll
stats) shows new activity; logs show the receiver emitting batches.

---

## H. No cases appear

**Symptom.** Cases / Scans are empty after deploy.

**Likely cause / fix.**
- **Nothing in scope.** Lower `severity_threshold` (a high value filters
  everything); check `in_scope_rules` (empty = all) and `excluded_rules`; confirm
  `suppression_rules` aren't dropping the events.
- **Correlation threshold not met.** The default correlation is `threshold`, `n=5`
  in a 120s window — a handful of stray events won't form a cluster. Lower `n`,
  widen `window_seconds`, or use `every` for rare/high-sev rules.
- **Source field-mapping wrong** (pull) — see D: rows arrive but the entity/rule
  fields don't resolve, so nothing correlates. Verify the mapping.
- **No poll / no push yet.** For pull sources run `POST /api/poll`; for push
  sources confirm the receiver is up (F/G) and the source is sending.

**How to confirm.** `POST /api/poll` returns non-zero counts; `GET /api/cases`
lists cases.

---

## I. Duplicate cases (this should not happen)

Cases are keyed by an **entity-centric cluster signature** (one open case per
`(entity_type, entity_value)`). Re-polling **attaches** new events to the existing
open case instead of creating a duplicate; the durable cursor uses an inclusive
lower bound + boundary-id dedup. If you genuinely see two *open* cases for the same
entity, confirm the entity values are byte-identical (a closed historical case does
not block a new open case for later activity).

---

## J. Enrichment / RAG / Standup "degraded"

**Symptom.** Thin enrichment, weak RAG, or the deterministic standup fallback.

**Likely cause (by design these degrade gracefully).**
- **Enrichment** (AbuseIPDB/VirusTotal): without keys, reputation context is
  limited; GeoIP already in the source is still read.
- **RAG embeddings**: without an embedding/OpenAI key, the gateway **falls back to
  local hashing embeddings**; on Postgres without pgvector, to JSON cosine.
- **Standup**: if the summariser model is unavailable, it returns the
  **deterministic** summary.

**Fix.** Add the relevant keys (`ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY`, `VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY`,
`EMBEDDING_API_KEY` / `OPENAI_API_KEY`), or accept degraded-but-working behaviour.

**How to confirm.** The usage ledger records provider failures as `outcome: error`
(visible in the **Cost** summary). A standup summary that is *not* the
deterministic fallback means the model is reachable.

---

## K. Cost panel empty

**Symptom.** `GET /api/usage/summary` shows zeros.

**Likely cause / fix.** No LLM calls in the window yet, or the usage store isn't
being written (ES backend not connected / mgmt-key issue; on SQL, a DB write
failure). Run something that calls a model (investigate, chat, standup), then
re-check. Candidate cases registered by the poller cost **nothing** (deterministic
risk only), so a queue of candidates with an empty Cost panel is expected.

**How to confirm.** `GET /api/usage/summary?window_hours=24` returns non-zero
`call_count`/`total_tokens`.

---

## L. Kill switch engaged

**Symptom.** Polling stopped; investigations return a `needs_human` case with
*"Kill switch engaged; investigation skipped."*

**Fix.** Settings → **Caps & kill switch** → uncheck **Kill switch** → Save (or
`PUT /api/settings -d '{"caps":{"kill_switch":false}}'`). With `setup_complete`
true and `polling_enabled` true, saving restarts the poller.

**How to confirm.** `GET /api/settings` shows `caps.kill_switch:false`; a
subsequent `POST /api/poll` runs normally.

---

## M. "Everything routes to NEEDS_HUMAN"

**Symptom.** Every case lands in `needs_human`, often with low/zero confidence.

**Likely cause.** No or invalid LLM key → the system **fails safe to a human**
(the router defaults to UNCERTAIN; any pipeline failure yields `needs_human`
rather than dropping the alert). Chat shows "assistant unavailable" in the same
situation.

**Fix.** Configure a valid provider key (Settings shows `anthropic_api_key:
configured ✓` and/or `openai_api_key: configured ✓`); confirm the per-role model
names are valid for that provider.

**How to confirm.** The provider shows configured; the usage ledger stops logging
`outcome: error` for completions; new investigations produce real verdicts.

> This is fail-safe behaviour, not a bug: routing to a human beats silently
> dismissing an alert.

---

## N. Settings won't save / read-only

**Symptom.** The Settings form is disabled, or a PUT returns `403 Settings are in
read-only mode`.

**Fix.** Disable `read_only_settings_mode` (the PUT that turns it off must set
`read_only_settings_mode: false`):
`curl -X PUT .../api/settings -d '{"read_only_settings_mode": false}'`.

**How to confirm.** `GET /api/settings` returns `"read_only": false`.

---

## O. Invalid `correlation_rules` JSON

**Symptom.** The per-rule correlation editor shows an invalid-JSON hint and
changes don't persist; a PUT returns `422 Invalid settings`.

**Fix.** Make it valid JSON — a map of rule value → `{ mode, n, window_seconds,
group_by }` (see `docs/USAGE.md` §9). A `422` means schema validation failed (e.g.
`n < 1`, unknown `mode`/`group_by`).

**How to confirm.** Save succeeds; `GET /api/settings` reflects your map.
