"""Connector registry — discovery for built-in and third-party connectors.

Built-ins (the Elastic/OpenSearch pull connectors and every push receiver) are
registered here. Out-of-tree connectors register via the ``tlsoc.connectors``
entry-point group, so the community can ``pip install tlsoc-connector-<vendor>``
and have it appear in the wizard with zero core change.

The registry's primary consumers are the first-run wizard (``manifests()`` lists
every connector + its auth/config fields) and the source-wiring code (maps a
configured ``SourceType`` to its connector class).
